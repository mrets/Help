# Reserve Account Overview

A reserve account is an account that is used to designate certificates as “reserved”. Transferring certificates to a reserve account removes the certificates from circulation and does not make any status usage changes to the certificates. Once certificates are placed in a reserve account they can no longer be transferred to another organization. Reserve accounts and the transactions associated with them are considered permanent. Reserve accounts differ from a retirement in the sense that the certificates and their retirements are not managed by M-RETS. Certificates deposited into a Reserve Account will be settled and claimed outside of M-RETS. The M-RETS Administrator cannot verify an environmental claim for certificates deposited into the Reserve Accounts. 

### To Access your Reserve Accounts select the 'Accounts' dashboard from the menu on the left, and select the 'Reserve' tab
