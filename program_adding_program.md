Adding a Program
================

This article will describe the basics of the Program feature. 

NOTE: This article is intended for Regulators. If you received an email invitation to participate in a program, navigate [here](https://mrets.github.io/Help/program_participating_programs).

OVERVIEW
--------

The Programs feature allows for the creation of specific criteria and eligibilities to be used in order for certificates to be retired. A Program Administrator invites participants to a program and can create eligibility requirements that must be met such as vintage, fuel source, generator location, eligibilities, etc. Programs can be set up for either voluntary or compliance use. 

GETTING STARTED
---------------

In order to see the new feature and create programs, you will need to enable Program permissions.

This is the ruleset page. Program Administrators can establish criteria that certificates must meet in order to be counted towards the Program. *PLEASE NOTE THAT NO RULES ARE REQUIRED*

-   Vintage Start
-   Vintage End
-   Eligibilities
-   Project Location
-   Fuel Types
-   Projects

In the below example, certificates can only be retired that have a vintage of Jan 2023 to Dec 2023 and they must have Minnesota eligibility applied to them.

After you have applied your rules, if any, select "Continue". The next page will allow you to invite participants to your  program.Â 

-   Select the dropdown and select the organizations to invite to your program.  NOTE: All selected organizations will receive an invite via email. Participants must accept this invite before they can create associated accounts or do any program retirements.*
