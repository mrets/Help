# Reporting Thermal Generation

Any user with Generation Submittal permissions can submit Dth data into M-RETS. Each time M-RETS receives generation data for a generator, the date and quantity of Dths are posted to the Generation Log. Any
fractional remainders will not issue certificates but will roll over to the next month of generation. Once uploaded, data will be labeled with one of the following:

<ul>
  <li>Accepted: Applies to all generation less than 1 Dth reported to M-RETS. The system will add this data to the subsequent month of generation for issuance.</li>
  <li>Issued: Applies to all generation 1 Dth or greater and indicates the Certificates are now active.</li>
  <li>Pending: Generation that fails feasibility and therefore needs M-RETS approval; or generation waiting to receive a ‘Feedstock’ allocation from a multi-feedstock generator. Pending Generation is not issued and therefore not represented by Active certificates.</li>
  </ul>

## Uploading Generation

### Navigate to the Generation tab and select the "Add New Entry" button.

### Add Generation

![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/generation_rt_3.png?raw=true)

<ul>
  <li>Generator: The generator for which you are uploading Dth.</li>
  <li>Start Date: The date on which generation began.</li>
  <li>End Date: The date on which generation ended.</li>
  <li>Quantity Dth: Generators must report 100% of the gas injected into the system from the Generator at the injection point, even if the gas will not be tracked in M-RETS.</li>
  <li> Is this 100% renewable?: Users must declare whether the generation is 100% from renewable sources, or if the Generator used non-renewable sources.</li>
  </ul>

Users may upload all their generation for the whole month or in partial months as long as a whole month is uploaded.

**Generators must report 100% of the gas injected into the system from the Generator at the injection point, even if the gas will not be tracked in M-RETS. This ensures that M-RETS can serve as a central repository for programs, including those not affiliated with M-RETS, to ensure against double-counting.**

### Allocation

![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/generation_rt_4.png?raw=true)

M-RETS will not create certificates for the generation entered and designated as not being tracked on M-RETS. Generation that does not qualify for certificate issuance is called Non-Qualified Generation. Non-Qualified Generation includes Generation intended for a program that does not recognize M-RETS or is not considered renewable (e.g., non-renewable additives). Qualified Generation is any generation that qualifies for certificate issuance.

### Generation Document

![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/generation_rt_7.png?raw=true)

Certificates created by Generators that Self-report (i.e. Generators that do not use an IRE) must also submit with the generation information an invoice, receipt, or other official documents that identify the Dth of gas injected. *If the documentation does not use Dth, the documentation must include values that would allow the M-RETS System Administrator to determine the Dth value. If this is not possible the Generator must work this out with the M-RETS System Administrator before uploading.*

M-RETS reserves the right to reject the Generators documentation if there is any reason to suspect the documentation provided is altered, fraudulent, or suspicious. M-RETS also reserves the right to confirm with the entity that issues the document(s) that they are legitimate and not altered in any way. M-RETS may—but is not required to— contact the Generator Owner before confirming with the entity. However, M-RETS will try to work out any issues with the Generator Owner before
confirming the validity of the documentation with the issuing entity.
