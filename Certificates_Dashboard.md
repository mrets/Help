# Certificates Dashboard Introduction

Welcome to the M-RETS! 

In this article, we are going to look at an overview of the Certificates Dashboard. 

Your Certificates Dashboard view should look something like this. ***Please note, your tabs on the left may vary.***

Each tab within the Certificates Dashboard will display relevant data and information pertaining to your certificates. 

<br>

You will see options to change from 'Active',' Retired', or 'Market'. Below these buttons, you will see the total  RECs under each status within your organization.

## The Table

The main source of data is the RECs table. In the table, you will notice the following columns by default:

-   Account: Where the RECs are currently located.
-   Account ID: The ID assigned to an account in the M-RETS database.
-   M-RETS ID: The identification number of the generator.
-   Organization
-   Generator: The name of the generator. 
-   Fuel Type: The Fuel type of the generator associated with the RECs. 
-   Vintage: The month and year that generation occurred.
-   Generation Start: The start date of the generation RECS were issued for.
-   Generation End Date: The end date of the generation that RECS were issued for.
-   Location: The location of your generator.
-   Type: The type of certificate, most likely REC.
-   Eligibility: This column will display for which programs these RECs are eligible.
-   Quantity: The number of RECs issued.
-   Serial Numbers: The serial number of certificates.

You will also see a 'Details' button which provides a condensed version of the information in the table.
Lastly, you may see a 'Generation' button which provides the user with a data visualization of the generation corresponding to their RECs.

## The Table: Filtering

You will notice inside each column label the text: 'Filter...'.This feature is for limiting what is shown in the column. Example: If I only wanted to see my solar RECs, I could select the filter under 'Fuel Type' and select 'Solar'.
