# Adding a New User to an Organization

***M-RETS requires every person that logs into the system to have their own separate user login credentials.*** M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each user through the unique user ID and password. There is no limit to the number of users an organization can have. Sharing logins is prohibited.

Users can be assigned three types of permissions:
1. None -  Inability to view or edit the topic
2. Manage - Ability to view and edit the topic
3. Read - Ability to solely view the topic

## Adding A User


### 1. Select your user name in the upper right corner, and select "Organization Info".
