How to Make an Hourly Claim
===========================

M-RETS developed a process to provide for the first hourly REC retirement in a production registry and we are excited to share this with our users. This guide will walk you through the process. The hourly retirement process embeds the hourly production data into the retirement claims process. This exciting achievement does more than just integrate hourly data into the claim. The process verifies that REC batches retired for hourly claims are whole and not split. The process allows for multiple batches to be retired at once and provides aggregate hourly data by hour, day, and month for the batches subject to the transaction.

**M-RETS allows Hourly Claims only for intact (i.e. not subdivided after issuance) batches of Certificates. The following will render a batch of certificates ineligible for an hourly claim:**

**1. Certificates that an Organization has separated into multiple active batches for any reason, even if they maintain ownership of all the RECs from the original issuance.**
**2. Certificates in a batch where RECs from the issuance batch were transferred to another party.**
**3. Certificates where any of the RECs from the batch as issued were retired.**

If you have questions about whether your Certificates qualify for Hourly Claims, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.**

### 2. To check if certificates are eligible for an hourly retiernment: scroll to the right of the Active RECs table and find the "Generation" profile, you can select this and you will be given the hourly generation profile of the generation selected. This indicates that the batch is eligible for an hourly retirement.

Select the eligible batch of certificates and select "retire".

### 9.  You may view and download your hourly generation by clicking “Hourly Claim Data”. Here are a few important things to know:

**1.The system defaults to Coordinated Universal Time. If you would like to view in a different time zone you need to select that. **

**2.MISO provides all hourly data to M-RETS based on the Eastern Time Zone, even if the generator is physically located in a different time zone. **

**3.If you are retiring multiple batches of Certificates, the data points shown is aggregated (i.e., the sum of each hour) for all the generators. **

**4. If you retire certificates over multiple months to see the data per hour per month you will need to use the download feature.**

Based on the location of the Generator, you may see data outside of your selected vintage which will appear as a dash ( - ). Timesthat fall within the time zone of the generator but where there is no generation will be shown with a zero (0).
