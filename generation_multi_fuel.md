# Entering Fuel Split for Multi-Fuel Generators

Multi-fuel generators require the user to enter a fuel-split(or fuel-allocation) before the certificates are issued. You can find a pending fuel split in two ways
1) Notifications dispalyed from the main dashboard
2) Pending tab located in the Generation dashboard 

## Pending Fuel Split Notification
When Generation data is loaded for a multi-fuel generator, a popup notification will be displayed on the main dashboard like the one listed below. By selecting "View Pending Generations" button, the user will be taken to the Pending tab of the Generation dashboard. The user can enter the fuel split from this screen.

## Entering a Fuel Split 
### From the main dashboard navigate to the "Generation" dashboard from the vertical menu and select the "Pending" tab. The User will see all generation in Pending status. Generation with the Status: "Pending: Waiting for Fuel Split", is ready for the user to report the fuel split and issue the certificates.

### The User will then enter the appropriate fuel split percentages for the generation. The total must add up to 100%. For generators that use non-renewable fuel(s), certificates will only be issued for renewable or Alternative Energy Certificate designated fuel types.
