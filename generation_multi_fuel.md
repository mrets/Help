Multi-Fuel Issuance: Entering Fuel Splits for Multi-Fuel Generators
===================================================================

After uploading generation for a multi-fuel generator you will need to input a fuel split before certificates are issued. Multi-fuel generation can be uploaded either via a csv or through the system interface. Per the M-RETS Operating Procedures, generators are required to report 100% of their generation and allocate fuel splits to non-renewable fuel sources if applicable. 

There are two ways to complete a fuel split. 

## Method One: Fuel Split Via the User Interface
### 1. Navigate to the "Generation" Dashboard and select "Add New Entry".

### 2. Input the required information and select "Next".

The certificates are now issued and can be found under the Certificates Dashboard. 

## Method Two: Generation in Pending Fuel Split Status

The second method for multi-fuel generators to input a fuel split is through the pending generation tab after the generation has been uploaded via CSV. The generation is placed in a "Pending: Waiting for Fuel Split" status. 

### 1. Navigate to the "Generation" Dashboard and select the "Pending" tab.

### 2. Scroll to the right of the Pending table and select "Fuel Split" for the generation.
