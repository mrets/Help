Inactivating a User from your Organization
======================================

This article will walk through how to remove a user by setting them to Inactive. M-RETS can not delete users from an organizations record. 

In order to maintain data integrity, the user will be set to 'Inactive' status. This means the user will not be able to log in or make changes, but any history pertaining to their use of the system will not be lost.

It is the organization's responsibility to make sure user lists are kept up to date. 

1) Select your name in the upper right corner, then select 'Organization Info'.
