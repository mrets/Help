Inactivating a User from your Organization
======================================

This article will walk through how to remove a user by setting them to Inactive.

It is the organization's responsibility to make sure user lists are kept up to date. If you have a coworker leave or retire, and you know they have an M-RETS user account their M-RETS login will need to be inactivated. 

In order to maintain data integrity, the user will be set to 'Inactive' status. This means the user will not be able to log in or make changes, but any history pertaining to their use of the system will not be lost.

1) Select your user name in the upper right corner, then select 'Organization Info'.
