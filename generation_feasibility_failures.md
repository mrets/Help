Feasibility Failures
====================

M-RETS has a feasibility formula in place that is triggered when the generation is uploaded and the system believes the generation to be over what is expected. The system places flagged generation in a Pending: Capacity Feasibility state. 

To override the feasibility failure:

1.  Contact <systemadmin@mrets.org> and please include the following:

(a) any necessary supporting documentation (e.g. meter read, a screenshot of your data acquisition software, invoice, etc)
(b) include the name of the generator and M-RETS ID 

Once the M-RETS Administrator(s) review and confirm your data we we will process the upload and the system will notify you via email that certificates have been issued.
