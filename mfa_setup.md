# Enrolling in Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

M-RETS has updated our multi-factor authentication (MFA) sign-in options for enhanced security. As part of this update, the use of the Authy app has been discounted. Instead, users with MFA enabled will need to request their authentication code via SMS or Voice call. This MFA method ensures secure access by combining your credentials with a time-based one-time password obtained on your trusted mobile device.

MFA will be an opt-in process for Organizations for the time being. Our implementation will support receiving the MFA key via SMS or phone call. Our goal is to make it as flexible as possible. If you have any concerns or thoughts you would like to share as we complete this work, please contact systemadmin@mrets.org.

In today's digital landscape, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as the gold standard for protecting against compromised passwords and security threats. By adding an extra layer of verification to system authentication, MFA significantly reduces the risk of falling victim to phishing scams and password sharing.

Don't leave your organization vulnerable to attacks. If you're not using MFA, you're exposing yourself to one of the biggest security threats - compromised credentials. We strongly encourage all organizations and users to consider opting in for MFA and take their security to the next level.

* Disabled. Do not require a verification code.
* Every login. Always ask for verification code.
* Once per computer. Trust computers and only ask for verification code every 30 days.
