# RECs Tab: An Introduction

Welcome to the M-RETS! Come in! Make yourself at home, but please take off your shoes.

In this article we are going to look at an overview of the RECs tab. I will attempt to cover all of the basics you need to know to use the RECS tab. 

Your RECs view should look something like this. ***Please note, your tabs on the left may vary.***

Let's start at the top!

## The Top

You will see options to change from 'Active' to 'Retired'. Below these buttons, you will see the total corresponding RECs under each status. Which brings us to...

## The Table

The main source of data is the RECs table. In the table you will notice the following columns by default:

-   Account: Where the RECs are currently located. For more, see Accounts Tab: An Introduction
-   M-RETS ID: The identification number of your generator.
-   Project: The name of your generator. For more, see Projects Tab: An Introduction
-   Fuel Type: Solar, Wind, Hydro, etc.
-   Vintage: When the RECs were created
-   Location: The location of your generator
-   Type: The type of certificate, most likely REC
-   Eligibility: This column will display for which programs these RECs are eligible
-   Quantity: The number of RECs issued
-   RRC Adjusted Quantity:  This is specific to the Wisconsin RRC program. Not sure what the Wisconsin RRC program is? Then this most likely can be ignored.

## The Table: Rearranging Columns

If you prefer a different layout of columns, then click on the header and drag it to a new location.

## The Table: Filtering

You probably noticed the buttons labelled 'Filter...' near the top of the columns. This feature is for limiting what is shown in the column. Example: If I only wanted to see my solar RECs, I would click on the filter under 'Fuel Type' and select 'Solar'.

## Settings: The Gear

Don't want to see all of these columns? No problem! Click on the gear icon.

Un-check any columns that you do not want included in the table.
