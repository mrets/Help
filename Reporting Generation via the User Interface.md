## Input any fuel splits for the generation (if applicable) 
If the generator is a multi-fuel generator you will be presented the opportunity to input each percentage or quantity of that fuel source. Note: your interface may look different depending on the characteristics and fuel source(s) associated with the generaotr. 

After inputting the fuel split(s), select 'Next'.

In M-RETS when generation is reported the system will calculate the expected generation for the generator based on the fuel source, nameplate capacity, and capacity factor. If the reported volumes are expected the system will issue certificates immediately. There are two instances where generation enters a pending state:

** Pending Capacity Feasibility: generation fails the capacity feasibility formula. Please submit documentation to validate reported volumes to systemadmin@mrets.org and we will move the generation entry to issued.

** Pending Date Feasibility: The reported generation is outside of the three-month upload window allowed by M-RETS, the M-RETS admin will approve the entry.
