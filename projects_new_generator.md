# Register a New Generator

The following information will guide you through the steps necessary to register a Project in your M-RETS® organization account. M-RETS is available to assist you throughout the registration process. Please call 651-900-7891, or email at <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

<br>

## Review Registry Operating Documents

The Registry Operating Procedures detail the requirements and definitions of different types projects. The Operating Procedures are available [here](http://www.mrets.org/resources/documents/). If you have not yet registered an M-RETS Organization, visit our Organization registration page [here.](http://app.mrets.org/register)

<br>

### Register a Generator


#### After logging in, select the 'Generators' tab on the left.

![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/new_generator1b.png?raw=true)

You will now see any Active generators in your Organization.

<br>


#### Select 'Add New Generator' on the right side.


![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/new_generator2b.png?raw=true)

<br>

#### Give your generator a name and select 'Save Draft'. You can change the name later in the process.


Your generator is now in "Draft" mode. You can continue to update your generator, however, make sure you save changes by selecting the 'Save Draft' button. Once you have filled in all of the information required (indicated by an asterisk), you will be able to submit the generator registration to the system administrator for approval. If you are not sure what a field is asking, please consult the table at the bottom of this article. If you are still unsure please contact the M-RETS System Administrator. 



## Uploading Supporting Documents

1.	A completed on-line Generator registration form containing information related to the characteristics of the Generator Asset and associated meter.
2.	If applicable, a completed [Schedule A](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MRETS-Schedule-A-Modified-12-28-2017.pdf) from the M-RETS Terms of Use outlining the Generator Owner’s Designation of Responsible Party. 
3.	Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration information which could include:
    * Utility Signed Interconnection Agreement
    * Utility Certificate of Completion
    * State Air Permit
    * State or provincial regulatory order 
    * Providing a Generator's EIA Entity ID which is an official, unique identification numbers assigned by EIA can expedite the approval process. The EIA Entity ID is required for all Generators over 1 MW in the United States and may be found by accessing the report here. 
    * FERC Qualifying Facility certification (FERC Form 556)
    * PURPA Qualifying Facility approval documentation
4.	If this Generator will use MISO as the reporting entity, fill out and upload this form in the Generator documents. It is important that the form reflects the correct MISO node. 
5.	Documentation supporting the capacity factor calculation and annual output of a generator, (E.g., solar design tools such as Aurora, HelioScope, PVsyst, PV Watts, etc.)
6.	Multi-fuel Generators must submit to M-RETS a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each fuel type, the method of determining the net heat content and moisture content of each fuel source, and the heat rate of the Generator. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.
7.	Generator Assets with installed battery backups must provide documentation to illustrate that grid power used to charge the battery is not metered as generation from the renewable Generating Asset. 


Use the Documents tab interface to upload documents. By Selecting the blue "Upload Document" a local search function can be accessed.

## Submission and Review


#### PLEASE NOTE: Your generator must be submitted or it will not be accepted.

The M-RETS Administrator will then be notified of the New Asset Registration via email. Your project will then be put into Pending mode until the System Administrator Approves the project or asks for further information. 

***Please Note: By submitting a generator for approval, the user represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its knowledge, information and belief. Any changes after submission may result in a delay in the approval process.***
