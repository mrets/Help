# Register a New Generator


Learn how to register a new generator or project in M-RETS.

The following information will guide you through the steps necessary to register a Project in your M-RETS® organization account. M-RETS is available to assist you throughout the registration process. Please call 651-900-7891, or email at <systemadmin@mrets.org>.

<br>

## Review Registry Operating Documents

The Registry Operating Procedures detail the requirements and definitions of different types projects. The Operating Procedures are available [here](http://www.mrets.org/resources/documents/). If you have not yet registered an M-RETS Organization, visit our Organization registration page [here.](http://app.mrets.org/register)

<br>

### Register a Generator


#### After logging in, click on the 'Generators' tab on the left.

You will now see any Active generators in your Organization.

<br>

#### Click on 'Add New Generator' on the right side.

<br>

#### Give your generator a name and click 'Save Draft'. You can change the name later in the process.

Your generator is now in "Draft" mode. You can continue to update your generator, however, make sure you save changes by clicking on the save draft button. Once you have filled in all of the information required (indicated by an asterisk), you will be able to submit the generator registration to the system administrator for approval. If you are not sure what a field is asking, please consult the table at the bottom of this article. If you are still unsure please contact the M-RETS System Administrator. 

The System Administrator will try and approve generators submitted with all the required information within seven days. If you need your generator approved sooner, please email <systemadmin@mrets.org> and communicate your deadline.

## Uploading Supporting Documents


1.  You can find required documentation by the link [HERE](https://www.mrets.org/resources/documents/)

-   Schedule A -- for projects registered by a Designated Responsible Party
-   Documents that verify ownership and Nameplate Capacity.  (Interconnection Agreement, Power Purchase Agreements, Contracts, Engineering Reports)
-   MN Air Permits -- For MN Eligible Multi-fuel Projects
-   Multi-fuel Report (OP Appendix B-3)
-   State Certification documents (OH, WI)

Use the Documents tab interface to upload documents. By clicking the blue "Upload Document" a local search function can be accessed.

## Submission and Review


#### PLEASE NOTE: Your generator must be submitted or it will not be accepted.

The M-RETS Administrator will then be notified of the New Asset Registration via email. Your project will then be put into Pending mode until the System Administrator Approves the project or asks for further information. 

***Please Note: By submitting a generator for approval, the user represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its knowledge, information and belief. Any changes after submission may result in a delay in the approval process.***
