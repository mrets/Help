# Mass Certificate Transfers

M-RETS has released new functionality that allows for the mass transfer of certificates via csv to either an active account or external organization. 

## To Mass Transfer Certificates

1. Filter the "Active" certificates dashboard by the batches you wish to transfer. In this example, I will filter by vintage range of 01/2020 to 12/2020. Once filtered, select the download button, you will need to take information from the downloaded CSV later.

2. Navigate to the Registry Documents section of the M-RETS website (https://www.mrets.org/resources/documents/). Under the "Mass Certificate Transfers" section download the "Mass Certificate Transfers Template". We will then input the necessary information into the CSV.
