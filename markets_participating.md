# Participating in a Market

This guide will walk you through participating in a Market in M-RETS. 

The first step to Participating in a Market is to accept your invitation. To accept a Market invitation a user must have "Manage" permissions for both Programs and Markets. For a guide on user permissions refer [here](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_adding_new_user). After logging into the System you will see a message at the top of your dashboard.
