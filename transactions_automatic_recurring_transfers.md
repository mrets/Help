# How-To: Automatic Recurring Transfers and Irrevocable Transfers

(Formerly known as Forward Transfers and Standing Orders)

After logging in, select 'Transactions' on the left. You will now see there are three options on this page: Pending, History, and Recurring. Select Recurring. This is where you will see your recurring transfers.

This article is broken up into steps in order to combine all possible transfers into one document.

### Internal Transfers

Select your account(s) from the menu. If you select multiple, you will see them populate at the bottom of the screen.

<ul>
  <li>Enter a percentage split based on your accounts. **NOTE**: They must add up to 100%.</li>
  <li>You can drag the different accounts to reprioritize them. In the event the quantity to be transferred does not divide evenly it will send the majority to the first listed account.</li>
 <li>The system will display when a remainder has been assigned to an account.</li>
  <li>Click 'Review Transfer'</li>
  </ul>

<br>

### External Transfers to other M-RETS Organizations

-   Enter in a percentage of RECs to transfer
-   When everything looks correct, select 'Review Transfer'.

**NOTE**: Recipient organizations are still required to accept automatic transfers.
-   You should get an email notification that the transfers are completed. If you didn't, might I suggest checking your notification preferences? Our guide to notifications preferences can be found [here](https://mrets.github.io/Help/billing_email_notifications).

Automatic Recurring Transfers can be set as Irrevocable during the confirmation of the transfer. Simply check the box labeled "Set Irrevocable", and your transfer will be set this way.
