How to filter and manipulate data across the data display and report interface

## The Table: Filtering

You probably noticed the buttons labeled 'Filter...' near the top of the columns. This feature is for limiting what is shown in the column. Example: If I only wanted to see my solar RECs, I would select the filter under 'Fuel Type' and select 'Solar'.
