# MISO Generation Reporting

M-RETS has an agreement with MISO to pull generation data from generators that are 5MW in capacity or larger and located in the MISO region. MISO Market Participants that would like to use MISO as their Qualified Reporting Entity must submit the [MISO Generator Data Release Form](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M-RETS-MISO-DATA-RELEASE-2-9-2018213.pdf). MISO reports data for M-RETS Generators using the Commercial Pricing Node (CPNODE).  "The standard naming convention for CPNodes is to have the NERC Registered Balancing Authority (BA) or Local Balancing Authority (LBA) acronym followed by a “.” and then an asset name of the MP’s choosing made up of with the rest" ([MISO Business Practice Manual 10](https://www.misoenergy.org/legal/business-practice-manuals/)).  If the CPNode registered with MISO is not known, contact the MISO Helpdesk for assistance (1-866-296-6476, option 1)

## To use MISO as the Qualified Reporting Entity: 
* Fill out the [MISO Generator Data Release Form](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M-RETS-MISO-DATA-RELEASE-2-9-2018213.pdf) and send it to systemadmin@mrets.org 
* In the subject line, include the M-RETS ID and "MISO Data Release". In the body of the email list the name of the generator(s)
* The M-RETS Administrator will send the data release along to MISO for processing
* Ensure that you have updated the CPNode for the M-RETS generator and changed the reporting entity to MISO
