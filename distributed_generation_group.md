# Distributed Generation Groups (DGG)
For small (<=1 MW) customer-sited Distributed Generating Units, M-RETS will allow aggregation (“Distributed Generation Groups”) of units not metered together and which do not share the same location, but which are located within the same state or province, and which otherwise share the same essential generation characteristics. 

Aggregated units into a DGG must meet the following criteria:

1. The M-RETS State/Province programs allow for aggregation if an eligibility is sought
2. The Aggregated Units do not exceed a total nameplate capacity of 1 MW

M-RETS will require documentation to be submitted for each Distributed Generating Unit to verify the unit’s engineering, interconnection and ownership which may include an Interconnection Agreement, Certificate of Completion and Schedule A. Micro-Generator Project Subscriptions are only authorized to register up to 100kW of project registrations. This account type will not be permitted to register DGG registrations. 

## How to Register a DGG
DGG functionality must first be turned on for an M-RETS Organization. Please contact systemadmin@mrets.org to request use of this feature. 
Once the feature has been enabled by the M-RETS Administrator, please follow the below steps to register a DGG. 

### Step 1 : Navigate to the "DG Groups" dashboard located in the left side menu

### Step 2: From here, select "Add New DG Group" to access the Distributed Generation Group registration

### Step 3:  Complete each registration section. The fields required are similar to that of registering a standalone generator in M-RETS

*General Tab*

Group name: M-RETS does not require any specific naming convention, DG groups can be named at the discretion of the organization registering them. 
DG Group Type: Groups can contain either residential, commercial, or a mix of both distributed energy resource types.

*Units Tab*

Step 4: The Units tab is where you will enter the required information for each unit that makes up a group. Select "Add", you will then be taken to the Add Unit screen. Complete the required information and select 'Save'
Expansion Indicator:  If the unit being registered is an addition to an already registered project, check 'Yes' for this field. If it is a standalone new DGG unit check 'No'

*Documents Tab*

Step 5: M-RETS will require that documents are submitted to verify each unit of a DGG, including but not limited to:

* Interconnection Agreement 
* Engineering Documents 
* Certificate of Completion 
* Ownership documents

M-RETS will require that a Schedule A is completed for units that are not owned by the Organization that is registering the units. The M-RETS System Administrator may request additional documents as needed. 

Step 6: Once all the required fields are entered in, select "Submit Generator". The DGG will then be placed in a Pending status and the M-RETS Administrator will review the registration
