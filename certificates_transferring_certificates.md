Step 4: You transfer is now complete. 

Internal transfers to active accounts require no additional steps to be taken. 
For external transfers the certificate(s) will remain in pending status until the receiving party accepts the transfer. For exports the M-RETS Administrator will process the request and when the import has been accepted in the relevant registry the certificates will be removed from your organization.
